You are OpenHands. Generate ONE self-contained file named index.html based on the provided JSON spec.

Inputs:
- Spec JSON: {{SPEC_JSON}}

Hard constraints (MUST follow):
1) Output exactly ONE file: index.html
2) Inline EVERYTHING: CSS in <style>, JS in <script>
3) No external libraries, no CDNs, no <script src>, no remote images, no fetch/network calls
4) Must be mobile-friendly and look high quality (modern cards, soft shadows, good spacing, subtle animations)
5) Must include:
   - top progress bar + "Step X / N"
   - 2–4 scenes with interactivity per scene
   - exactly 1 mini-game (from spec)
   - quiz checkpoint with 4 MCQs:
       - show which option user selected if wrong
       - show correct option
       - explanation after each question
   - reset button (clears progress)
   - completion screen with recap

UI expectations:
- neutral light grey base background
- high-quality typography (system font stack ok)
- smooth transitions
- no emojis

Implementation details:
- Use a simple state machine: currentStep, score, scene completion flags
- All interactions must actually affect state (unlock next, update progress)
- Make it resilient: no console errors
- Keep file size under ~500KB

Deliverable:
Return the full content of index.html ONLY. No extra text.
