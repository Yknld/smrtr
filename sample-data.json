    "keyTakeaways": [
      "Linear regression models the relationship between independent and dependent variables",
      "The least squares method finds the best-fitting line by minimizing the sum of squared residuals",
      "R² (coefficient of determination) measures how well the model fits the data",
      "Linear regression assumes a linear relationship and normally distributed errors"
    ],
    "concepts": [
      {
        "title": "Least Squares Method",
        "plainExplanation": "The least squares method is a mathematical approach used to find the best-fitting line through a set of data points. It minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances (residuals) between the observed values and the values predicted by the line.",
        "bullets": [
          "Minimizes the sum of squared residuals",
          "Provides a unique solution for the regression line",
          "Works well when errors are normally distributed"
        ],
        "example": "If you have data points (1,2), (2,4), (3,5), the least squares method finds the line y = 1.5x + 0.5 that best fits these points.",
        "whyItMatters": "This method is fundamental because it provides an objective way to determine the 'best' line, making it the standard approach in statistical analysis and machine learning."
      },
      {
        "title": "Coefficient of Determination (R²)",
        "plainExplanation": "R² is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable(s). It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.",
        "bullets": [
          "Ranges from 0 to 1",
          "R² = 1 means perfect fit (all points on the line)",
          "R² = 0 means the model explains no variance",
          "Higher R² indicates better model fit"
        ],
        "example": "If R² = 0.85, it means 85% of the variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable.",
        "whyItMatters": "R² helps you understand how well your model performs and whether it's useful for making predictions. It's a key metric for model evaluation."
      },
      {
        "title": "Slope and Intercept",
        "plainExplanation": "In the equation y = mx + b, 'm' is the slope (how steep the line is) and 'b' is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis when x = 0).",
        "bullets": [
          "Slope (m): Change in y for each unit change in x",
          "Intercept (b): Value of y when x = 0",
          "Positive slope means y increases as x increases",
          "Negative slope means y decreases as x increases"
        ],
        "example": "In y = 2x + 3, the slope is 2 (line goes up 2 units for each 1 unit right) and the intercept is 3 (line crosses y-axis at y=3).",
        "whyItMatters": "Understanding slope and intercept helps you interpret what your model is telling you about the relationship between variables."
      },
      {
        "title": "Residuals",
        "plainExplanation": "Residuals are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the regression line. They represent the error in the model's predictions.",
        "bullets": [
          "Residual = Observed value - Predicted value",
          "Good models have small, randomly distributed residuals",
          "Patterns in residuals suggest the model may be missing something",
          "Residuals should be normally distributed for valid statistical inference"
        ],
        "example": "If the model predicts y = 5 for a point, but the actual value is y = 6, the residual is 6 - 5 = 1.",
        "whyItMatters": "Analyzing residuals helps you diagnose problems with your model and understand where it's making errors."
